# Daryl's Standard Library

The Daryl's Standard Library (DSL for short) is a base library for multiple DSL libraries. These libraries can be used to create C++ applications and are developed with Embedded Programming in mind. Using these libraries, a lot of boilerplate code that is needed for programming is done for you. While writing this README, the following modules are created:

-   DSL Entities; can be found on [DarylStark/dsl_entities](https://github.com/DarylStark/dsl_entities)
-   DSL EventBus; can be found on [DarylStark/dsl_eventubs](https://github.com/DarylStark/dsl_eventbus)
-   DSL Utilities; can be found on [DarylStark/dsl_utilities](https://github.com/DarylStark/dsl_utilities)
